/*
Given an integer array A of N integers, find the pair of integers in the array which have minimum XOR value. Report the minimum XOR value.
Example Input 1:
A = [0, 2, 5, 7], Output : 2, Explanation: 0 xor 2 = 2
A = [0, 4, 7, 9], Output : 3

Idea : Sort the array. The answer will be the minimal value of X[i] XOR X[i+1] for every i.
Proof:
Letâ€™s suppose that the answer is not X[i] XOR X[i+1], but A XOR B and there exists C in the array such as A <= C <= B.
Next is the proof that either A XOR C or C XOR B are smaller than A XOR B.
Let A[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of A
Let B[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of B
Let C[i] = 0/1 be the i-th bit in the binary representation of C
This is with the assumption that all of A, B and C are padded with 0 on the left until they all have the same length
Example: A=169, B=187, C=185
A=10101001
B=10111011
C=10111001

Let i be the leftmost (biggest) index such that A[i] differs from B[i]. There are 2 cases now:
1) C[i] = A[i] = 0,
then (A XOR C)[i] = 0 and (A XOR B)[i] = 1
This implies (A XOR C) < (A XOR B)
2) C[i] = B[i] = 1,
then (B XOR C)[i] = 0 and (A XOR B)[i] = 1
This implies (B XOR C) < (A XOR B)

Time complexity: O(N * logN) to sort the array and O(N) to find the smallest XOR
Space complexity: O(1) [ Heap Sort ]
If Merge Sort is used Space Complexity would be O(N)
